# app
This is a simple app that uses socket io + angularjs v1.2.32.

The client sends a message to the server and the server broadcast this message back.

### TODO:
- Create a new project on Github
- Right now it is only showing the last message. We need it to list all the messages sent in a session. It could be a list `ul > li`.
- Add the date and time for each message.
- Add a validation, don't let the user hit send if there nothing to be sent.
- The current implementation it is only broadcasting the message to the sender, make it broadcast the message to all the users that have the app opened.
- Make it looks like chat app.

#### Plus:
- Allow the users to have a nickname.
- Allow the users to enter a room name.
- Make it pretty.
